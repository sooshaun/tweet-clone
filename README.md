# DB Tables

I made 3 tables for my app, User, Tweet and Profile. User stores the user information like passowrd etc. Tweet stores the information message that a user tweets and the Profile table stores information about the user.

Each user has one profile and many Tweets.
Tweet has one User.
Tweet belong to User.

## Tweet
